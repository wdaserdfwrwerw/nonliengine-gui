# Nonliengine-GUI (Safe Version)

> A GUI-based logical simulator system (Safe Version to prevent technology leakage)

This project is a GUI-based logic simulator that allows users to input natural language or structured knowledge, which is then visualized as sequence diagrams, property tables, and formula networks. Users can simulate and explore logical structures interactively using this interface.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a Safe Version**, meaning it excludes core algorithms (reinforcement learning, spiral inference engine, automatic explanation systems, etc.) to prevent leakage of key technologies.

## üîß Features

- Auto-generation of sequence diagrams (e.g., `Gravity(Earth‚ÜíObject)`)
- Automatic extraction and display of related variables
- GUI-based logic structure visualization
- Visual tracking of logical paths and used formulas
- No inference, reinforcement, or calculation systems included

## ‚ñ∂ How to Use

1. Run `main.py`
2. Input natural language or knowledge ‚Üí sequence diagram auto-generated
3. Related variables are displayed in the table
4. Users can simulate logic by entering input values and observing flows

## üéØ Project Goal

This project was originally developed as a prototype for an R&D-level logic engine. The long-term vision is to unify natural language understanding, logical reasoning, reinforcement learning, and structural simulation into one seamless GUI system.

This **Safe Version** is for public demonstration purposes and excludes any confidential or advanced inference mechanisms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This version **does not include** any key reasoning algorithms to prevent technology leakage. It is intended for safe public sharing only.
